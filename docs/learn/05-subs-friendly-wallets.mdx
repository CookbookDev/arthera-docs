title: Subs-friendly wallets
---

As an EVM-compatible network, Arthera can be used with almost any existing crypto wallet. However, some of them do not fully support ‘zero-gas-fees transactions’ yet. This is the case for MetaMask for instance.

We’re in the process of verifying the compatibility of 300+ wallets, but as of today we know that the following wallets allow users to interact with smart contracts without paying any gas fees:

- [Enkrypt ](https://www.enkrypt.com/) (by [MEW](https://www.myetherwallet.com/))
- [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
- [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/)
- [Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io/)
- [Rabby](https://rabby.io/)
- [Zerion](https://zerion.io/)
- [Taho](https://taho.xyz/)
- [XDEFI](https://www.xdefi.io/)

The notion of ‘zero-gas-fees transactions’ is also supported by most of Solidity contracts development tools including [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).
