To achieve a frictionless experience for your customers, you need an on-chain subscription for your dApp on the Arthera blockchain. We call this a Contract subscription and you can find more about them in the [Contract subscriptions](/learn/about-arthera/pricing-models#contract-subscriptions) section.

Basically, as long as your dApp has an active Contract subscription to the Arthera chain, any whitelisted user that transacts with your dApp contract(s) doesn't pay anything. Instead, their gas fees for transacting with the network is deducted from the Contract's subscription.

To make things even more streamlined, the Arthera chain allows users to work with your DApp without even owning AA or any other cryptocurrency.
The chain allows whitelisted zero-balance wallets to transact with Contracts that have an active Arthera on-chain subscription.

You can manage you Contract (dApp) subscription from the On-Chain page of the SMP. You will need a Metamask wallet to do so.

The first thing you need to do is to **Get a Subscription**. To do so, enter your smart-contract address and buy a plan that suits your needs. Don't worry if you don't choose the proper plan now, as you can upgrade it anytime later.
The price of the subscription is charged in AA coins, so be sure to have enough AA in your selected wallet to pay the subscription price.

After you purchase your first subscription to the Arthera chain, you will see the details of the subscription:

Click the **Set as default** button to use the new subscription as default for your dApp.

Any gas fees incurred by your customers that transact with your dApp smart contract will be deducted from the **default** subscription.
